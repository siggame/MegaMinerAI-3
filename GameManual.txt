  Ending Conditions
    The game ends when there are no more humans alive or when the game
    has reached its turn limit.
    The turn limit is 1000 but is subject to change.
    For the tournament, you win a match against an opponent if your
    humans live longer.
    To break ties, we will use your remaining time.
    The humans should never live to turn 1000.


  Time Limit
    You will be given a set amount of time plus some time per turn.
    These values are currently 30 seconds + 1 second per 
    turn but are subject to change.
    If you run out of time as the humans, all of your humans die.
    If you run out of time as the zombies, the turn number is set to the
    max turn limit.

  Game updates
    Even if not specifically mentioned, all constants are subject to change.
    After midnight, we will try to only make changes to the game if they
    are critical or by popular demand.


Map
  Hexagons
    The map consists of hexagons arranged in a diamond formation.
    The map shown below would have a "radius" of 1 because it goes
    from (-1,-1) to (1,1).  The positive X-axis is down and to the right.
    The positive Y-axis is up and to the right.
           __
        __/  \__
     __/  \D_/  \__           
    /  \__/  \__/  \
    \E_/  \A_/  \C_/
       \__/  \__/
          \B_/
    A = ( 0, 0)
    B = ( 1,-1)
    C = ( 1, 1)
    D = (-1, 1)
    E = (-1,-1)

  Square grid equivilent
    If you don't like hexagons, you can imagine that the game takes places
    on a square grid.  The positive X-axis to the right.  The positive Y-axis is
    straight up.  A unit can move left, right, up, down, down-right, or up-left.

  Distance
    By our definition of the map, this handy little formula will calculate 
    the distance between two points.

      dx = targetX - startX
      dy = targetY - startY
      if (dx * dy > 0):
        dis = abs(dx) + abs(dy)
      else:
        dis = max(abs(dx), abs(dy))

  Adjacency
    Two hexes are adjacent if the distance between them is 1 as defined by
    the above formula.  This should be easily visible from the ASCII image.


Humans
  General
    Humans get 3 moves per turn which they can use to move or build.
    Humans get 1 unit of time per turn which they can use to
    fire weapons (see Weapon Delay).

  Spawning
    Spawn your humans anywhere on the map as long as there is not
    a wall or another human there.
    You can only spawn humans the first turn.
    They can start with any weapon except zombie arms.  Use the weapon's
    canCall and canSpawnWith functions before you try to call for a crate
    or spawn with them.

  Sight
    Humans can see anything within a radius of 8 (subject to change),
    which is practically the entire map.

  Move
    Humans can move to any hex that meets the following criteria:
      It is adjacent.
      It does not contain another human.
      It does not contain a wall.
      It does not contain any zombies.
    This action requires a move.

  Attack
    Each weapon inflicts 3 Kinds of damage: Direct, Vertical splash,
    and Horizontal Splash.
    Direct damage is applied to the targeted unit only.
    ATTACKING GROUND FORFEITS DIRECT DAMAGE.
    Vertical splash damage is applied to every object in the targeted hex.
    Horizontal splash damage is applied to every object within the
    horizontal splash radius.
    This action requires a move.

  Weapon Delay
    Weapon delay can be confusing, so here is the function that determines
    wether or not you can fire your weapon.
    
    success = (weaponDelay < human.idleTime)
    if (success):
      human.idleTime -= weaponDelay
      if (human.idleTime > 1):
        human.idleTime = 1
    
    Notice the < operator is NOT the <= operator.
    This function attempts to model real time.
    Imagine your human is holding a weapon with a delay of 3 has been waiting
    around for a long time. His idleTime is infinity.  You see a zombie and
    fire at the beginning of your turn.  His idleTime is now 1 because he still
    has the rest of this turn to perform actions.  Say he drops his weapon and
    picks up a new weapon with a delay of 0.5.  He can fire it once.  Now he
    has an idle time of 0.5 because he spent 0.5 of this turn firing this
    new weapon.  He can not fire it again this turn, but is ready to fire it at
    the very beginning of his next turn.  If you stick with this weapon forever,
    turn, you will be able to fire it twice

  Sharing!
    Humans have functions for dropping their ammo and weapons, creating crates
    on the map.
    To make ammo sharing easier, humans have a function for giving their ammo
    directly to another human.
    Humans can pick up weapons and ammo.
    
    
  Pick up an ammo crate
    The amount of ammo gained is equal to the crate's HP.

  Build
    Humans can create a new wall with a small amount of HP or add this HP
    to an existing wall by targeting the desired hex.
    New walls can only be placed where there are no humans or zombies.
    This action requires a move.

  Call for Drops
    The local government is not willing to expose its troops to the infection,
    but it is willing to occassionally drop supplies.
    You can call for a drop containing a specific weapon or an ammo box.
    A pending airstrike is visible only to the human team.
    After a set number of turns, the crate falls from the sky, dealing a lot 
    of damage to anything it lands on (currently 200 vertical splash damage).


Zombies
  General
    Zombies can overlap each other.
    Zombies have a low sight range.
    Zombies can smell humans.
    Zombies are facing a specific direction.  Most actions must be applied
    to objects that are directly in front of them.
    The zombie team can not see crates or airstrikes at all.
    Zombie starting HP increases linearly over time.
    Zombies will become much more numerous over time.
    Zombies get 1 move per turn.
  Sight
    Zombies have poor vision.  They can see anything within a radius of
    2 (subject to change).

  Spawning
    You can only spawn as many zombies this turn as are ready.
      Your client has a function to determine how many are ready to spawn.
      If you don't use them, you lose them.  You can't save them up.
      The frequency of zombies ready per turn increases linearly over time.
    You can only spawn more zombies if you have not reached the zombie cap.
      Your client has a function to determine the current zombie cap.
      The zombie cap increases linearly over time.
    Zombies are spawned by choosing a spawn zone.
      A spawn zone is placed along each of the 4 sides of the map.
      The zombie is placed in a psuedo random hex inside this area.
      For an explanation of the pattern used to choose the next hex, ask
      Stephen Mues.


  Eat
    Zombies can eat other zombies to recover health.
    This action requires a move.
    The targeted zombie must be in the same hex or immediately in front
    of the cannabal.

    THE CONSTANTS GIVEN HERE ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.
    The amount of health gained is twice the HP of the eaten zombie.
    Zombies can be healed to 1.5 times their starting health.
  Move
    Zombies can move to any hex that meets the following criteria:
      It is adjacent.
      It is in front of the zombie.
      It does not contain a human.
      It does not contain a wall.
    This action requires a move.
  Facing
    0 is the positive X-axis
    1 is the positive Y-axis
    5 is the max value of facing.

        __/  \__

    /  \3_/  \1_/  \
    \__/  \Z_/  \__/
       \4_/  \0_/
          \5_/

  Turning
    Zombies can call their turning function with 1 for CW or -1 for CCW.
    This value is added to their current facing, rolling over from 5
    to 0 and vice versa.
    This action requires a move.

  Scent
    Each zombie is assigned a scent value that vaguely describes
    the location of the humans.
    
    For each zombie:
      scent = 0
      For each human:
        if (the human is in front of the zombie):
          scent += 1 / (distance between the zombie and human)

    See definition of "in front" given below

  In front
    If the zombie, labeled Z, is facing in direction 2 (up), the hexes labeled
    O are considered in front of it.
